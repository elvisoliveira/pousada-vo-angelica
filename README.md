# Pousada Vó Angélica

This project aims to restore one of the first commercial websites I ever built. The company that owned the website ceased operations over a decade ago. The project serves solely as a personal, historical, and archival endeavor.

## Background
The original website was completed in 2008 while I was employed at a company called **Markar**. While I managed to recover the full original HTML from the Wayback Machine, the CSS and images were lost. To reconstruct the website's appearance, I rewrote the entire CSS based on my recollection and retrieved images from the company’s still-active Facebook and Twitter pages.

## Reconstruction Process
- **HTML Restoration:** The complete original HTML was recovered from the Wayback Machine.

```

- **CSS and Images:** I recreated the CSS from memory, striving to match the original design as closely as possible. Images were sourced from the company’s official social media accounts.

- **Static Site Generation:** I used a Ruby-based static site generator (SSG) called **Middleman** to organize and assemble the website files.
- **Publishing:** The restored site is published on **GitHub Pages**.
